Clone, npm-install and then
`npm run test`
(it will run headlessly)

In order see the test run in a browser (headed) do:
`npm run test-headed`

Also, if you want to report the result into a file (see example 'output.log') you may try this on a bash terminal:
`npm run test > outputFile.log`

Otherwise you might open the Cypress suite:
`npx cypress open`
And choose happyPathLogin.cy.js
